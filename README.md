# Car Sharing Service

**Introduction**

Welcome to the Car Sharing Service project! This initiative aims to modernize and enhance the existing car sharing system in our city. The current manual and paper-based tracking system lacks efficiency, and this project will introduce an online management system to streamline processes and improve user experience.

**Technologies Used**

- **Spring Boot:** Framework for developing the backend application.
- **GitHub:** Version control and collaborative development.
- **Trello:** Task management and organization.
- **Maven:** Build automation and project management tool.
- **Checkstyle:** Ensures code style consistency.
- **Swagger:** Generates interactive API documentation.
- **Docker:** Containerization for deployment.
- **MySQL:** Database management system.
- **JUnit:** Testing framework for unit tests.
- **Testcontainers:** Provides lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases.

**Project Structure**

The project is organized into several controllers, each responsible for specific functionalities:

- **Authentication Controller:** Handles user registration and login.
- **Users Controller:** Manages user roles and profiles.
- **Cars Controller:** CRUD operations for car inventory.
- **Rentals Controller:** Manages user car rentals and returns.
- **Payments Controller (Stripe):** Facilitates payments through the Stripe API.
- **Notifications Service (Telegram):** Sends notifications for new rentals, overdue rentals, and successful payments.

**Tasks and Infrastructure**

The project follows a structured development process, including setting up GitHub organization, branch protection, checkstyle, continuous integration, and database integration with Liquibase. It also includes creating a Trello board for task management and implementing Swagger documentation for the API.

**Coding Standards and Best Practices**

- **Checkstyle Plugin:** Ensures adherence to coding standards.
- **Separate PRs:** Each task is completed in a separate pull request for better code review.
- **Test Coverage:** Aiming for 60% or more coverage with meaningful tests.
- **Meaningful Commits:** Branch, PR, and commit names follow consistent practices for clarity.

**Infrastructure and Deployment (Optional)**

For advanced users, the project includes the option to deploy the app to AWS, ensuring scalability and reliability.

Explore the various controllers, understand the defined models, and contribute to the development of a modern and efficient car sharing service. Happy coding! ðŸš—ðŸ”§
